# SCPSLCustomSpawnpoints

## It's a bit of a confusing plugin to use, and is very easy to break, so read carefully!

## Config files are stored in a yaml format.

## Example

`csp_reload` - requires `customspawns.reload`

`csp_help` - requires `customspawns.manage` as well as the following commands

`csp_list_items`

`csp_list_rooms`


`csp_list_roles`

`csp_spawn_add spawnname roomname [looking(true|false)]`

`csp_item_add spawnname itemname 0.78 [groupname]`
